					<h2 class="project-subtitle">Problem</h2>
					<div class="description">
                        <p> Contemporary private museums have multiplied all over China since the beginning of the 2000s. Monthly, new museums and art institutions seem to arise out of the blue. Merely in 2011, 451 new private museums (contemporary and other-periods focused) established across China. It is evident that the quantity of private museum exceeds that of public museums, and private museums are more modernized compared to the public sector. A decade ago, the Chinese government forbid exhibiting modern and contemporary art, while today contemporary-related exhibitions are ubiquitous. So the question is: Why are these private contemporary museums multiplying? 
						<br><br>	
						One obvious cause reflects the rise of China’s GDP. The country’s growth supplemented vast amounts of wealthy collectors and personal collections, rocketing China’s influence onto the international art market. But with such an abundance of wealth, why is there no ‘prestigious’ museum in China similar to MoMA in New York, The Louvre in Paris, or The Tate Modern in London? Why did this rapid ‘museumfication’ increase museum quantity but not museum centralization? Is there a fundamental difference between Western ‘traditional’ and Eastern museum functions, or is it China’s process of creating a new definition for museums? How does the art community regard this happening?

					<h2 class="project-subtitle">Motivation</h2>
					<div class="description">
                        <p>	
						These questions root themselves into my early childhood. With both parents as artists, who participated the beginnings of Chinese contemporary art, I gained a special identity, which the media calls, “Yierdai,” (a derivative of the newly coined term, ‘Fuerdai') or, “Children of Nouveau riche Artists.” Often, my childhood memories were of myself darting around installing exhibitions, which later I discovered were forbidden to exhibit. Interestingly, my mother produced her first contemporary installation when I was in her womb. For these underground artists, there were no platforms for exhibitions and no museums to visit due to political enforcements and other limits in resources.
						<br><br>
						As an alternative, these ‘avant-garde’ artists displayed their works within their studios for short periods of 2 to 3 days, and the attendees were only of their small contemporary art circle. In the early 2000s, my parents established Beijing’s first art institutions, called “The Loft New Media Art Space”. In prideful retrospect, the art space was a percussing embodiment of today's museumification frenzy. A Chinese article labeled it, “The Last Utopian Art Space.” Idealistic and non-profit, the institution intended to offer a platform for underground performance art exhibitions, theoretical discourse, avant-garde films, and experimental music. Unfortunately, the institution closed down, and today, its location became one of Beijing's most voguish and energetic districts, the Sanlitun Village.
						<br><br>
						This sudden popularity of private museums not only reveals the public's interest in these institutions but has also ignited my juvenescent memories, which were connected to these Kunsthalle spaces. Therefore, I intended these conversations with museum individuals to understand the causes of Loft New Media Art space’s closure; to appreciate why these once forbidden art spaces, where I ran around as a child, has suddenly multiplied. I intended to use the fortunate resources I have been given and create a special perspective as to record this current happening. To that end, over the past 3 summers since 2015, I progressively investigated into contemporary art museums all over China, where I interviewed 51 individuals–museum directors, founders, CEOs, curators, and art collectors.

					<h2 class="project-subtitle">Scope</h2>
					<div class="description">
						<p>These 51 individuals, making up 40 institutions, are chosen purely based on recommendations and only compose a fraction of the 200 – 300 hundred private contemporary museums in China. They were picked mostly through the ‘spreading-of-word’ from the earlier interviewee, or they are commonly cited amongst other popular contemporary art world establishments. That said, the selection does not include public museums nor museums that does not focus on contemporary art. As to the structure of this volume, the notion of interviewing individuals derives from my previous volume of work <a href="motive.html">(Motive)</a>.
						<br><br>
						Recording the conversations of these individuals–museum founders, directors, CEOs, collectors, and curators–brings forth a private side of these institutions that is otherwise a public label; their dialogue brings to light the direction and foundations these institutions strive and build upon, rendering them as a growing cultural entity. Without a doubt, the spoken word reads and feels very different from a written one. While it has been extremely difficult to translate these oral interviews into print and later into Chinese or English, the discourse of an interview often generates spontaneity that keeps this massive compilation interesting. 
						<br><br>
						Being unaffiliated with any art news institutions, my questions caught many interviewees unguarded. It is apparent in the dialogue when the interviewee exerted extra efforts to reorganize their explanation about their institutions, perhaps since it was a sensitive subject. On the other hand, interviewing a few interviewees, who were also in my previous volume, gained more fluidity, where they were more honest and open in their responses. More importantly, this interview format gave leverage to different individuals, as some directors were more political with their words, while others came from academic backgrounds, whom mostly studied writing. This outcome was something I have failed to realize in the beginning.
						<br><br>
						Another interesting personal development in the project is my realization of my biases within the museum and artist relationship. My background did provide me perceptive points in terms of my inquiry; however, as I have overheard very much of my parent’s and family friend’s comments towards different aspects of the art world, I developed unsubstantiated viewpoints of the Chinese art museums. Thus, the interviews have also educated me in the opposite spectrum of the art world: markets and collections, reshaping me with a more neutral stance.

					<h2 class="project-subtitle">Analysis / Conclusion</h2>
					<div class="description">
                        <p>Of course, the interviews themselves were anything but dull. To my surprise, an unanticipated increase in the interviewee’s willingness to answer my questions came during the later stages of my interviews. As my interviewee numbers increased, more individuals accepted my interview requests, and they answered more questions, some as if a way to promote and record their institutions. Of course, never was it my intent to help these institutions publicize themselves; therefore, my questions increased in perception as many of them targeted known sensitive areas. However, what I was not prepared for was their aspirations and hopes for the fertility of museums in China. While many artists, generally, perplexed about existing museums, these museum individuals foresee a bright future that requires a transition with structure-reorganization, a cleansing of sort. Interestingly, the younger the museum, the more specific their mission was. These observations, of course, I can go on forever…
						<br><br>
						The scale of this book is purely frightening to read. Therefore, I concentrated some of the crucial points, which I thought were important in the dialogues, and listed them in a separate section called: My Findings. However, the least of this volume’s design is my attempt to conclude the general direction of Chinese contemporary private museums. It is, but rather, my subjective findings clarified into bullet-points, which again, is highly likely to be inaccurate. I have also collected data such as ticket prices, museum creation dates, number of visitors, and have placed them with possible connecting quotes from the interviews. Additionally, since I intend to trace the beginnings back to Loft New Media Art Center, I have also created a timeline of the museums; a process to learn about how these institutions have evolved, their motives upon entering the world of art, and their differences through chronological development. The intended purpose is purely a subjective experience and data compilation, where these three sections organizes the entire compilation. If the volume were only interviews, it would have been a tedious journey to finish reading. With that said, the interviews are my attempts in capturing an objective, unadulterated, ‘snapshot’ of private museum creations in today’s China. 
						<br><br>
						These institutions and individuals that constitute this compilation form a time-slice for the ever-changing museum world. Each person offers a new possibility to the art world that, perhaps, is different from its traditional Western precedent. With the volume’s bilingual nature, the compilation, in my hopes, will become a record for China’s museumfication frenzy and a window for the Western world to look into China. These institutions will endure the changing tides of the art world and serve as compelling platforms or examples for the future international generation. Together, they have become a ‘snapshot’ of this current period of institutional change.
