					<p>Motive was one of my publications I created when I was 17. I wanted to interview art individuals inorder to understand how their daily rituals transcend into their art career.</p>

					<h2 class="project-subtitle">Introduction from the book</h2>
					<div class="description">
                        <p> "What’s provoking about this project, which I came to realize during the process of the interviews, is that I am one of those spoiled children born into a family of two famous artists, an second generation of an artistic aristocracy; a child who is able to cut corners while many others who are more devoted and more professional dream to have the chance of interviewing one of these art individuals. Having these special art related opportunities is like those heirs of business tycoons inheriting material wealth. It’s something I was born with, but I have to prove myself worthy to become the person I should be; I have to show that I am capable of making good use of my parents’ resources with discretion. In other words, I was only able to conduct this project on the basis of all the connections of my parents."
						<br><br>	
						"Despite my glorious conviction to justify myself, I am honestly clueless about what I want to do in the future. As a teenager living in this age of information, where all kinds of Internet resources and social media overflow, it’s extremely hard for me to grasp the profession/major I would like to pursue. It’s also the reason why I came up with this project, which aims to understand the ins and outs of the artistic circle through interviewing different prominent individuals, and try to get a sense of what it is like to be an interviewer."

						"My parents, being artists, are very liberal, and they have no preference towards my career. However, this brings me onto a journey--a journey where my parents put all their hearts into helping me find the dearest passion to my heart. Some may say that I am fortunate to be blessed with an easy life and a loving family, but sometimes I’d rather be forced onto a path with a definite direction, instead of strolling in one place looking into the vast sea of possibilities."
						<br><br>
						"During the 1970s and 80s, Chinese artists--many of whom are famous now--had very limited career opportunities. It was a time when the country was closed to the outside. However, limited as the resources were, these young people chose art, as it was the perfect way to explore their creative passion. This aroused my curiosity, and I wonder how these artists, with no previous role models to follow, gathered enough courage to venture into the realm of contemporary art. I am curious if they were politically and economically suppressed while doing art. What was their state of mind and what was the motivation that pushed them forward? And how did they develop their own perspectives? More importantly, how did they bring Chinese contemporary art out of underground to its current status as a competitor in global art market?"
						</p>

						"I became acquainted with many of these artists ever since I was a little boy, and their art accompanied me through my childhood. Naturally, viewing these works brings to mind my childhood, especially when I was brought to some of the earliest galleries in Beijing. It is a feeling mixed with nostalgia and joy; a feeling that evokes the meaning of home."
						<br><br>
						"It was during this time when I grew up (over the last 18 years) that Chinese contemporary art community experienced its most rapid growth. It was also during my mother’s pregnancy of me that she created her first installation work."
						<br><br>
						"Initially, my purpose for this book was not to understand the philosophy behind each artist’s work, but rather to focus on the attitudes each artist needed to achieve success. However, after interviewing a few artists I began to realize the entanglement between the daily life of the artist and his or her artistic philosophy."
